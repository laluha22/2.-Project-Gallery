# 2.-Project-Gallery

In this project, I learnt how to add css styles into the HTML page with a bit more detail and styling each element, including visual elements such as the background, font colours and font families. In terms of displaying the data live, I experimented with several flexbox options, such as “flex-direction” to display each card on the page. To confirm that the flexbox function is indeed flexible, I made sure that the cards resize based on device screen size. 

Elements such as pictures and descriptions were added upon finishing all my application stages. I also added the button function to display each description.
